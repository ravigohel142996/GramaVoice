THE PITCH (60 SECONDS)
================================================================================

My grandmother walked 8km to check her pension. They said "check online."
She can't read. 242 million Indians face this barrier.

GramaVoice lets them call, speak in their language, get help. AI understands,
pulls government data, responds by voice. No app, no reading, just speak.

Pilot: 1,100 users, 81% resolution, ₹12 lakhs subsidies, 8-day resolution
vs 32 days. Government gets real-time dashboard, heatmaps, predictive alerts.

This isn't just tech. It's dignity. We're bridging the gap from 1 village
to 300 million people. Help us scale. Thank you.

================================================================================
