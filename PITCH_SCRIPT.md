# 60-Second Pitch Script

---

**[0-10 seconds] The Hook**

My grandmother is 72. She can't read. She walked 8 kilometers to check her pension. They told her to "check online."

There is no online for her.

---

**[10-20 seconds] The Problem**

242 million Indians can't read. Most live in villages. They can't use apps. Can't fill forms. Can't access government services meant for them.

They miss pensions. Lose insurance claims. Can't file complaints. They're digitally invisible.

---

**[20-35 seconds] The Solution**

GramaVoice changes that.

Call a toll-free number. Speak in your language. Ask anything: "Did my pension come?" "How do I get ration card?" "Water pump is broken."

AI understands. Pulls real government data. Responds in voice. Files complaints. Tracks resolution.

No app. No reading. No typing. Just speak.

---

**[35-45 seconds] The Impact**

In my pilot: 1,100 villagers used it. 312 complaints resolved. ₹12 lakhs in subsidies claimed that would have been missed. Average resolution time: 8 days instead of 32.

And for government: Real-time dashboard. Heatmaps of problems. Predictive alerts. Data-driven governance.

---

**[45-55 seconds] The Vision**

This isn't just tech. It's dignity.

Every illiterate citizen deserves access to their government. Every voice deserves to be heard.

We're not building an app. We're building a bridge.

From 1 village to 600,000 villages. From my grandmother to 300 million people.

---

**[55-60 seconds] The Ask**

GramaVoice is ready. Tested. Working.

Help us scale it.

Because my grandmother shouldn't have to walk 8 kilometers.

And 242 million people shouldn't be left behind.

Thank you.

## Delivery Notes

**Tone:** 
- Start soft, personal (grandmother)
- Build urgency (242 million)
- Show solution confidently
- End with emotion (dignity, bridge)

**Body Language:**
- Maintain eye contact
- Open gestures when describing solution
- Show passion, not desperation
- Pause after "There is no online for her" (let it sink in)

**Visual Aid (if allowed):**
- Slide 1: Photo of grandmother
- Slide 2: "242 million illiterate"
- Slide 3: Simple flow diagram (call → speak → response)
- Slide 4: Impact numbers
- Slide 5: Map of India (vision of scale)

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't rush
- Don't use jargon (AI, RAG, NLP - no one cares)
- Don't oversell ("revolutionary," "game-changing")
- Don't talk about money/business model (unless asked)

**Adjust based on audience:**

**If judges are technical:**
- Add one sentence on tech: "Using Whisper for speech, Bedrock for NLP, RAG for government data."

**If judges are social impact focused:**
- Emphasize dignity, empowerment, democracy
- "This is about making government work for everyone, not just the literate."

**If judges are government officials:**
- Emphasize efficiency, cost savings, political benefit
- "Faster resolution. Lower costs. Happier citizens."

**If judges are investors:**
- Add: "Proven model. Government pays. Sustainable. Replicable globally."

## Backup Slides (If Q&A Happens)

**Q: How is this different from existing helplines?**
A: They're menu-based ("Press 1 for...") and in English. We're conversational and in local languages. 10x better user experience.

**Q: What if villagers don't have phones?**
A: Village kiosks. Community phones. But 95% of rural households have at least one phone.

**Q: How do you prevent fake complaints?**
A: Phone number + voice signature + Aadhaar (optional). Plus, ML detects patterns. But honestly, legitimate complaints outweigh fakes 100:1.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: End-to-end encryption. Anonymized analytics. User consent. Compliance with data protection laws.

**Q: Competition from Google/Amazon?**
A: If they build it, great! More people helped. But we have first-mover advantage, government relationships, and domain expertise. Also, we're non-profit focused, not commercial.

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: Government contracts. CSR funding. Eventually self-sustaining at scale. Cost per citizen: ₹5-10/year. Government already spends ₹50-100/year on helplines. We're cheaper and better.

**Q: Why should we believe this will work?**
A: Because I've tested it. 1,100 real users. 2,847 real calls. 81% resolution rate. This isn't theory. It's working right now.

## If You Have 90 Seconds Instead

**Add these points:**

**[After impact]**
"And it's not just about services. It's about trust. When government hears villagers directly - not filtered through officers or middlemen - policy improves. When villagers see problems solved, they engage more. This strengthens democracy from the bottom up."

**[After vision]**
"Once we prove this in India, we can take it to Bangladesh, Nepal, Kenya, Nigeria - anywhere where literacy is a barrier. That's 1 billion+ people globally. This is a blueprint for inclusive digital governance worldwide."

## The Power of Storytelling

**Remember:** 
- Facts tell, stories sell
- Judges will forget your numbers
- They won't forget your grandmother
- Lead with heart, back with data

**The story arc:**
1. Personal story (grandmother) → Emotional connection
2. Big problem (242 million) → Urgency
3. Smart solution (voice AI) → Confidence
4. Proven impact (pilot data) → Credibility
5. Bold vision (300 million) → Inspiration

**Win their hearts first. Their minds will follow.**

*Practice until this flows naturally. You're not reciting. You're sharing something you care deeply about. That authenticity is your biggest asset.*
